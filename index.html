									<h2>About Me</h2>

									<hr id="hr-1">

									<img id="profile" src="assets/images/31.jpg" alt="profile pic">

									<p id="about"> I was born and raised in the beautiful state of North Carolina. As a kid, I would always brag about North Carolina's trifecta of the ancient Appalachian Mountain chain, the rolling hills and farmlands of the Piedmont, and the picturesque coastal plains. I enjoy all that our state has to offer as often as I can.  
									</p>
									<p id="about"> I'm an avid learner and lifelong student. I attended David W. Butler High School, followed by the University of Chicago; upon graduation, I lived in the Windy City for a few years to work with local communities on social organizing campaigns. After a few years of hard work and unforgettable experiences, I made the decision to move back to my homestate and to look into a career in tech. 
									</p>
									<p id="about"> I certainly look forward to working with you all, and if you ever need a hiking buddy, give me a ring!</p>
