<!-- design idea : a simple webpage written with html5, css3, and javascript (ecma6) standards
this site will have a brief bio about me, display projects that exemplify my coding experience, and link visitors
to my professional and social media links -->
<!-- design styles
1. choose a logo or image that exemplifies me, and make it the background cover. all contented scrolls over it
2. choose a theme (like ships, or animalistic, or monochrome, animation style, and subtley incorporate it) 
3. no theme, just well designed. will update later. -->

<!-- must haves
1. about me section
2. portfolio
3. social media links -->
<!-- nice to haves:
1. contact section
2. navigation (no nav bar, but section headers, that popup after you scroll past my name)
	a. under name, about me (faded, smaller font)
	b. Current Work (portfolio)
		i. when you click on this section, you see a carousel (horizontal) of projects (cover image, when clicked starts gif, or gif starts when in place)
	c. always up, links to social media -->
<!-- a pseudocode plan
1. create the html, css, and js framework
2. modify the content to be displayed according to best practices from the bootcamp and online resources
	a. gifs for app walkthrough
	b. simple carousel, or scrolling content for portfolios
	c. design style or logo
3. Ensure that the webpage is accessible on the free github link. 
4. When ready, connect the page to your personal domain.  -->
